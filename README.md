Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) decoder

This software was developed within digital signal processing
course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology

In order to decode the image run sat_meteo.m

Right now it provides only basic functionality i.e. display
both grayscale and infrared images in one window. No extra
features. Below image of North America and Gulf of Mexico
